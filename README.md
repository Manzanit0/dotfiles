# My dotfiles

### Directories explained

`src/` contains my dotfiles.

`scripts/` contains some utility scripts I like for everyday use.

`bin/brew-install` to install brew-cask and basic list of recipes and casks.

`bin/install` to install both brew recipes, dotfiles and scripts. The ultimate install script :)
